  # Under 'fields', we list the data items to be imported. The first level keys
  # are the source field names we want to populate (the names to be used as
  # sources in the process configuration below). For each field we're importing,
  # we provide a label (optional - this is for display in migration tools) and
  # an selector (xpath) for retrieving that value. It's important to note that this xpath
  # is relative to the elements retrieved by item_selector.
  #item_selector: /response/variety
  # For Google Spreadsheet XML feeds the actual columns are named with gsx: followed by the cleaned column name (lower,
  # limited punctuation, etc).
