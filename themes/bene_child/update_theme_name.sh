# This script works on a theme that was started by copying bene_child.
# If the theme still has the name bene_child sprinkled throughout, this does the
# job of changing those instances of 'bene_child' to the new theme name. For
# example bene_cori had a bunch of places where it was still named bene_child.
# This script goes through the bene_cori directory and replaces those with
# bene_cori and does so in place. (Does _not_ create a new directory or a new copy.)
# It also renames the directory from bene_child to the new theme name if it is
# not already re-named.
#
# call like this:
# > cd theme/directory
# > update_theme_name.sh my_new_theme_name
